### Introduction
ac_gifts uses containers from [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) to create Christmas gifts.  
You can put any items in the gift container and wrap it. Then you can give it to another player who can unwrap it. Once the gift is unwrapped, it can't be wrapped again - no peeking!
